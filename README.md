You can call me C or Vyx (or just go *pspspsps* and I'll probably show up). I'm a storyteller, designer, and creative thinker with a deep passion for weaving meaning and beauty into everything I create. Whether it's crafting character-driven narratives in lore-rich worlds or designing aesthetic Notion workspaces and graphic designs, I thrive at the crossroads of functionality and artistic expression.

### ‚òï My cup of ~~tea~~ coffee
* **Symbolism and Mysticism**: From celestial designs and Celtic knots to floriography and astrological motifs, I infuse layers of meaning into my work, typically drawing on wellsprings of Welsh, Celtic, and Norse mythologies.
* **Color Harmony**: Exploring palettes inspired by elements, seasons, and even Pok√©mon types helps me bring out the emotional depth of every project. Exploring the way that colors work with each other and the human subconscious is always exciting.
* **Storytelling**: Above all, I'm a weaver of words. With an educational background in Creative Writing, Psychology, and Information Systems, my passions all converge at the heart of telling a story. Character growth, power dynamics, and the relationship between man and the divine are at the heart of my narratives. I love creating rich worlds and lore so deep you need to bring a shovel, often drawing from folklore and dark fantasy themes.
* **Video Games & TTRPG**: I love playing video games, and always have. I grew up with an older sister who named me after her favorite video games, and I haven't changed since then. Final Fantasy, Pok√©mon, Harvestella, Avowed, the list goes on. I also live in the tabletop gaming space, with 
* **Artificial Intelligence**: I don't have enough words to express what I love about ML and AI, so just ask - but be prepared for a PhD thesis worth of discussion.

### üßö‚Äç‚ôÄ My current flight path
* **Notion Workspace Makeover**: [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is one of my favorite tools for the creative flexibility it gives in leveraging custom icons and relational databases that can be used to form dynamic color palettes. Right now, I'm desgining a timeless and cohesive workspace featuring celestial and Celtic motifs with nature-inspired elements. After that, it's a cozy and sweet Pok√©mon Cafe theme centered around Eevee and its Eeveelutions.
* **Color Palette Refinement**: Experimenting with light and dark modes to make elemental-inspired palettes adaptable for various themes. I'm also on the path to create a Notion widget for building and saving color palettes.
* **Microsoft's AI Skills Fest**: Did I mention I love AI? Because I really do. Between April 8 - May 28, I'm taking part in [Microsoft's AI Skills Fest](https://aiskillsfest.event.microsoft.com/).
