You can call me C or Vyx (or just go *pspspsps* and I'll probably show up). I'm an author, gamer, and systems designer who thrives where storytelling meets structure. My creative work orbits around celestial calendars, interactive lore engines, and gamified mechanics that breathe life into fictional worlds.

***

## âœ¨ What I'm Working On Now

* **EosÃ­n Calendar Widget** for the *Legends of Lacuna* novels my partner writes and the world we build together, featuring dynamic moon cycles, seasonal shifts, and adaptable to any fantasy world to map real-world time to fantasy dates.
* **Prototyping in Capacities**, bridging conceptual worldbuilding with technical implementation.
* **Accessible, Seasonal UI Themes** with colorblind friendly palette-driven design as a means of enhancing narrative tone and player experience.
* **Lacuna Resonant Codex**, a narrative engine for tabletop campaigns and storytelling in the world of the *Legends of Lacuna*.

## ðŸ”® My Long-Term Vision

To build tools and frameworks that empower GMs, players, writers, and narrative designers to craft immersive, emotionally intelligent worlds - where lore isn't just a backstory, but a living, breathing part of the experience.
